## Deep Learning: Reinforcement Learning

1. A typical rl problems usually consists of three characterstics: 
      * Some sort of closed loop system
      * Not having direct instructions as to what actions to take 
      * Consequences of actions, including reward signals, play out over extended period of time.
      
2. Exploration vs Exploitation Dellima.

  The agent has to exploit what it already knows in order to obtain reward, but it has to also explore in order to make better action selection in the future. Learning by doing rather than notes/wrote learning.
