This is my personal tracker for resources as beginer in deep learning. It should take around 4 months to get a full hang of the foeld and start producing novel work.

Currently this includes 
1. Convolutional Deep Neural Networks for Image (Stanford)
2. Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (Stanford) 
3. Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research (Stanford)
4. Udacity Deep Learning Course (Google)
5. Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree (Siraj Rawal)
